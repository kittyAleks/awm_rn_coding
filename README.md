# Coding task guidelines
- clone project
- convert the profile screen from this figma [file](https://www.figma.com/file/eDaJ2KioiHUmL3maBn0zm4/coding_task_profile?type=design&node-id=0%3A1) into code
    - adjust the project code as you need
    - font is Outfit from Google [link](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit)
    - use the default or any other images/icons of your choice for graphic elements
    - feel free to use react native ui libs if you find it useful
    - note: pixel perfect is not expected for this task, your best effort will be good
- send me an email with a link to your code

Good luck!
